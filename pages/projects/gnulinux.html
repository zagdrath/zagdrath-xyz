    <h3>What is GNU/Linux?</h3>
    <p>Linux or GNU/Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds and The GNU Project, started in 1983 by Richard Stallman who had the goal of creating a complete Unix-compatible software system composed entirely of free software. Linux at its core is just the Linux kernel and Linux, along with the GNU system, it makes up a complete operating system.</p>
    <p>Together, releases of GNU/Linux are often dubbed Distributions or Distros, which include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Commonly mentioned Linux distributions include Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch. Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland, and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE. Because Linux is freely re-distributed, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose, you too may be so compelled to do so.</p>
